# Steps I took in Week 1 to get started on my project. 

# Part 1: clone the repository to local computer

# 1. Copy the HTTPS (clone) link from the repository's page in GitHub 
    (found under the green "<> code" button on the top right corner)
# 2. Open VSCode and Start a new terminal
# 3. cd to the location on your computer you would like to store the project on your local computer
# 4. paste this into the terminal: 

git clone [paste repo HTTPS url]


# Part 2: create a new branch in the project

# 5. cd into the project (just added to your local device)
# 6a. create a new branch (give it a descriptive name) and go into the branch to start doing work in there 
            --> paste this code into the terminal: 

git branch New_Branch_Name
git checkout New_Branch_Name

# 6b. alternatively, you can create a new branch and go into it all in one step with: git checkout -b New_Branch_Name

#7. double check that you are working in the new branch --> paste this code into the terminal: 

git branch

(The output should list all branches, with a * next to the currently active branch)

# 8. start working on your project as usual, and all the changes will be saved under your branch history

# Part 3: save changes back to remote repo

# 9. when you are doing working, save your changes back to the remote repo 
          --> paste this code into the terminal: 

git add .
git commit -m "[commit message]"
git push -u origin Branch_Name (OR git push --set-upstream origin Branch_Name)


# Part 4: create a pull request to have the branch changes merged back into the main branch

# 10. create a new pull request for your branch in GitHub; excellent dirrections here: 
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request

# 11. assign the pull request to a specific person for review; excellent directions here:
https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users
